Creating Sample Application
=========================

Create a JavaScript / Coffeescript application using AngularJS that will allow a user to search a repository by name and display a repository's relevant information such as URL, description, forks count, stargazers count, open issues count etc. Also, display the available issues of a repository in a separate section in the UI:

Implement the best design possible for the user interface - search and search results, and issues section.
You can use Twitter Bootstrap and any JavaScript libraries to support AngularJS (Underscore etc). Use best practices in writing JavaScript / Coffeescript, CSS, and HTML. Write clearly and use proper MVC structure to write the application.
Bonus: Add another section for visualisation chart (using a JavaScript charting library that you already know) for the number of forks, open issues, stargazer count, watchers count, or any relevant information about the repository.
